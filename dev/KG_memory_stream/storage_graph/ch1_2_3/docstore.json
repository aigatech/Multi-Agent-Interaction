say\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last\npeople you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,\nbecause they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\nneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't\nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.\nPotter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;\nin fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her\nsister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\npossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy\nwas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want\nDudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\ncountry.

Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite\nhappy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\ncould see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off\nto secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be\nwith Dudley.

Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite\nhappy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\ncould see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off\nto secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be\nwith Dudley.
