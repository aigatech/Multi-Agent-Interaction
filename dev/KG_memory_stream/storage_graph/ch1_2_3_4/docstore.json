They were the last\npeople you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,\nbecause they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\nneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't\nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.\nPotter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;\nin fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her\nsister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\npossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy\nwas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want\nDudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\ncountry. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\nwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd0d4ae8-b792-485e-ac8c-a695dd8550e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd0d4ae8-b792-485e-ac8c-a695dd8550e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/chapter/1.txt", "file_name": "1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25928, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-18", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "17d9e682-ef4b-48c3-9f15-79ee4e08ebdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/chapter/1.txt", "file_name": "1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25928, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-18", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-19"}, "hash": "6710d12ad8f41cdbba92acb43b88b0d7a8af316c4ef0db60cf6bd9cafd59d808", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "86bece76-388b-4693-8e96-911a928e1aca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/chapter/1.txt", "file_name": "1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25928, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-18", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-19"}, "hash": "63842975263c520a88b60adadd5771ba73d2d5d556bb6d7c29a9bc0f03c79b9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "366b7e96-96f4-4423-b81e-b7fc62b1124f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e285c7d17980cd8d5e0a25b4e61b81d457077be04cc1f1b047cb577d48972643", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street.

As he drove toward town he thought of\nnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in\nfunny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this\nwas some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering\nwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\nclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was\nenraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man\nhad to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\nnerve of him!

Only the\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.\nTen years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large\nblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a\ncomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.\nThe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made\nthe first noise of the day.\n\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\n\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then\nthe sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.

By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\nagain, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his\nnew video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time\nout on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet\nDrive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,\nwho visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite\nhappy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\ncould see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off\nto secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be\nwith Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private\nschool, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the\nother hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley\nthought this was very funny.\n\n\"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\"\nhe told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet's never had anything as\nhorrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before\nDudley could work out what he'd said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\nuniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's.

Only the\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.\nTen years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large\nblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a\ncomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.\nThe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made\nthe first noise of the day.\n\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\n\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then\nthe sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.

By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\nagain, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his\nnew video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time\nout on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet\nDrive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,\nwho visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite\nhappy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\ncould see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off\nto secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be\nwith Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private\nschool, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the\nother hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley\nthought this was very funny.\n\n\"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\"\nhe told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet's never had anything as\nhorrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before\nDudley could work out what he'd said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\nuniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as\nusual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,\nand she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before.
