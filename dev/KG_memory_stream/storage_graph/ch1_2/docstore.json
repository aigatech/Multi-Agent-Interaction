Privet Drive, were proud to say\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last\npeople you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,\nbecause they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\nneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't\nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.\nPotter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;\nin fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her\nsister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\npossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy\nwas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want\nDudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\ncountry. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\nwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eaa2427e-1bdf-464d-b6e2-a266fa43fbdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "eaa2427e-1bdf-464d-b6e2-a266fa43fbdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/chapter/1.txt", "file_name": "1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25928, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-18", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "72881534-a5e4-44b4-a377-b395163cb025", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/chapter/1.txt", "file_name": "1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25928, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-18", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-19"}, "hash": "6710d12ad8f41cdbba92acb43b88b0d7a8af316c4ef0db60cf6bd9cafd59d808", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "637a3fb0-c704-4f4d-b83a-a12ce5704e2e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/chapter/1.txt", "file_name": "1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25928, "creation_date": "2024-02-19", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-18", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-19"}, "hash": "63842975263c520a88b60adadd5771ba73d2d5d556bb6d7c29a9bc0f03c79b9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "234fe3e5-a6fe-443f-9e3f-f8a87d23209b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e285c7d17980cd8d5e0a25b4e61b81d457077be04cc1f1b047cb577d48972643", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street.

He got\ninto his car and backed out of number four's drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\nsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley\ndidn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet\nDrive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking\nof? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and\nstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the\ncorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.

He couldn't remember being in the car when\nhis parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long\nhours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding\nflash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he\nsupposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green\nlight came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and\nuncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask\nquestions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\nrelation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)\nthat strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers\nthey were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once\nwhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry\nfuriously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the\nshop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in\ngreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus.
